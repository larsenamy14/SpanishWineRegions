# Purpose
This purpose of this project is to visualize the various wine-growing and wine-making regions in France. 

# Process
The first step was to create a base layer to the map using the Javascript library Leaflet. 
The next step was to create GeoJSON files of each region in France using geojson.io.
The GeoJSON files were then added to the Leaflet map with Javascript language embedded in the HTML file.
